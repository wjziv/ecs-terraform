# .env

This is where we store our environment configuration files.

Environment Variables.
Secrets.
Feature flags.

All of the strings which your developers have decided are better to leave as configurable values defined outside of the codebase.

This directory is home to the values which are picked up in each environment, and developers will enter this directory only to add/remove secrets up decrypting/encrypting the files herein.
